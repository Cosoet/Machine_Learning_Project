Introduction

Making appropriate strategies to get maximize the profit is a challenge for every company. In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to find the most potential features, which can identify the customer will spend how much in the Google Merchandise Store. By predicting future users' revenue, we can make sure that every penny we spend on advertisements is worth. 

Background and Motivation

There are lots of machine learning algorithms developing rapidly nowadays. For example, Neural Networks and Deep Learning gets significant success in the field like speech recognition, computer vision, and text processing. However, for business data, we need a model which has higher interpretability to help us make decisions. Boosting  is an ensemble method  in Machine Learning which combines several base estimators to improve accuracy. Light Gradient Boosting Machine  or called LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. LightGBM gives us an interpretive result. Meanwhile, tons of information inputs into our learning algorithms. We use features selection  to reduce computing resources. In this project, we use the business data from Kaggle competition and combine the method of features selection and LightGBM to help us get an interpretive result and reduce computing resources.
